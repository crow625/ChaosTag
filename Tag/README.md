## Chaos Tag

Chaos tag is a group tag game where all players are simultaneously 'it'. When a player is tagged, they must sit down and cannot tag anyone. However, when a player is tagged, anyone they tagged is now back in the game and can tag others again. The game ends when a single person has tagged all the other players, or alternatively when a certain amount of time has passed.
